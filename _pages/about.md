I am a NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellow working at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and a soon to be Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Temple University in Philadelphia (Go Owls!). My work centers on using climate models to understand the ocean's role in the climate system and how it will evolve as the climate continues to warm. I have a particular interest in understanding Southern Ocean physical and biogeochemical dynamics and how the properties and circulation in this region will evolve. I also have a strong interest in building process-oriented diagnostics to investigate biases in ocean properties and circulation in coupled climate models.
